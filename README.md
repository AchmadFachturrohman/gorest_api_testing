1. `token_manager.py`
   - this code for:
     - Automatically log in to GitHub using Selenium.
     - Scrape the token from a specific page (likely the GoREST access token page).
     - Save the token to a .env file so it can be used by the automation pipeline.
     - Provide the Authorization header for API requests.
2. `login_manager.py`
   - this code for:
     - Automatically log in to GitHub using Selenium.
     - Scrape the token from a web page (likely the GoREST access token page).
     - Save the token to a `.env` file.
     - Provide the Authorization header for use in API testing.
3. `scenario.py`<br>
   Perform automated testing on the endpoint https://gorest.co.in/public-api/users using pytest, with the following scenarios:
   - Create user (positive & negative)
   - Get user (positive & negative)
   - Update user (positive & negative)
   - Delete user (positive & negative)
4. `conftest.py`<br>
   This code defines two fixtures for use in GoREST API testing:
     - `user_payload`: Provides valid user data for the create user test.
     - `user_holder`: Stores the user_id of the successfully created user, so it can be used in subsequent tests (get, update, delete).
6. `main.py`<br>
   This script serves as an automated entry point for:
   - Scraping the token from GoREST using TokenManager.
   - Running pytest tests on the scenario.py file.
   - Generating an HTML `report.html` from the test results.
